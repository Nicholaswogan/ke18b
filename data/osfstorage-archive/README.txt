Data from Madhusudhan et al. 2023: Carbon-bearing Molecules in a Possible Hycean Atmosphere, 2023, ApJL. 

These data correspond to the JWST transmission spectrum of K2-18 b reported in Fig. 3 of Madhusudhan et al. (2023), obtained with the JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H instrument modes. The data from the two instruments are given in separate files.  

The atmospheric retrievals in this work are conducted on the native resolution spectrum presented here, denoted with "native" in the filenames. The low-resolution spectrum presented here, denoted with "lowres", is used only for plotting purposes.
